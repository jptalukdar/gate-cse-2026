The GATE 2026 Computer Science & Information Technology (CSE) syllabus is divided into three main sections: **General Aptitude**, **Engineering Mathematics**, and **Core Computer Science**.

### 1. General Aptitude (15 Marks)

* **Verbal Aptitude:** English grammar, vocabulary, reading comprehension.
* **Quantitative Aptitude:** Data interpretation, ratios, percentages, powers, exponents, logarithms, permutations & combinations, mensuration, geometry, elementary statistics, and probability.
* **Analytical Aptitude:** Logic, deduction, induction, analogy, numerical relations.
* **Spatial Aptitude:** Transformation of shapes (translation, rotation, scaling, mirroring), assembling, paper folding/cutting, patterns in 2D and 3D.

### 2. Engineering Mathematics (~13-15 Marks)

This section is crucial as it often serves as a rank differentiator.

| Subject | Important Topics (Focus Areas) |
| --- | --- |
| **Discrete Mathematics** | **Propositional & First Order Logic**, **Graph Theory** (Connectivity, Matching, Coloring), **Sets, Relations, Functions**, Partial Orders, Lattices, Combinatorics (Counting, Recurrence Relations). |
| **Linear Algebra** | **Eigenvalues & Eigenvectors** (Very Important), **Rank & Determinant**, LU Decomposition, Systems of Linear Equations. |
| **Calculus** | **Limits, Continuity, Differentiability**, **Maxima & Minima**, Mean Value Theorem, Definite Integrals. |
| **Probability & Statistics** | **Conditional Probability & Bayes Theorem**, **Random Variables**, **Distributions** (Uniform, Normal, Exponential, Poisson, Binomial), Mean, Median, Mode. |

### 3. Core Computer Science Subjects (~70-72 Marks)

This is the heart of the exam. The subjects are listed below with critical topics you must master.

#### **I. Digital Logic**

* **Key Topics:** **Combinational Circuits** (Multiplexers, Decoders), **Sequential Circuits** (Counters, Flip-Flops), Boolean Algebra, Minimization (K-Maps), Number Representations (Floating Point - IEEE 754).

#### **II. Computer Organization and Architecture (COA)**

* **Key Topics:** **Pipelining** (Hazards, Speedup, Throughput), **Cache Memory** (Mapping techniques, Hit/Miss rates), **Addressing Modes**, Instruction Formats, Memory Hierarchy.
* *Note:* Pipelining and Cache are historically the highest weightage areas in COA.



#### **III. Programming and Data Structures**

* **Key Topics:** **Programming in C** (Pointers, Recursion - extremely important), **Trees** (Binary Trees, BST, Heaps), **Graphs** (Adjacency Matrix/List), **Linked Lists**, Stacks, Queues.

#### **IV. Algorithms**

* **Key Topics:** **Asymptotic Analysis** (Time/Space Complexity), **Sorting** (Merge, Quick, Heap Sort), **Graph Algorithms** (BFS, DFS, Shortest Paths - Dijkstra/Bellman-Ford, MST - Prim/Kruskal), **Dynamic Programming**, Greedy Algorithms.

#### **V. Theory of Computation (TOC)**

* **Key Topics:** **Regular Languages** (DFA/NFA construction, Regular Expressions), **Context-Free Languages** (Pushdown Automata, Grammars), **Undecidability** (Halting Problem, Turing Machines), **Closure Properties**.
* *Tip:* This is often considered a high-scoring subject if your concepts are clear.



#### **VI. Compiler Design**

* **Key Topics:** **Parsing** (LL(1), LR(0), SLR, CLR, LALR - FIRST & FOLLOW sets), **Syntax Directed Translation**, Runtime Environments, Intermediate Code Generation.

#### **VII. Operating Systems**

* **Key Topics:** **Process Management** (CPU Scheduling, Semaphores, Synchronization), **Deadlocks** (Banker’s Algorithm), **Memory Management** (Paging, Segmentation, Virtual Memory), File Systems.

#### **VIII. Databases (DBMS)**

* **Key Topics:** **Normalization** (2NF, 3NF, BCNF - Functional Dependencies), **SQL** (Queries, Joins), **Relational Algebra**, **Transactions** (Serializability, Concurrency Control).

#### **IX. Computer Networks**

* **Key Topics:** **IP Addressing** (Subnetting, CIDR), **TCP/IP Protocol Stack**, **Routing Algorithms** (Distance Vector, Link State), **Transport Layer** (TCP Flow/Congestion Control, UDP), Application Layer (DNS, HTTP, SMTP), Error Control (CRC, Hamming).

### Weightage Analysis (Last 5 Years Trend)

While weightage varies slightly every year, this is the general hierarchy:

1. **High Weightage:** Data Structures & Programming, Algorithms, Operating Systems, Discrete Mathematics. (Expect 8-12 marks each).
2. **Moderate Weightage:** DBMS, Computer Networks, Theory of Computation, COA. (Expect 6-9 marks each).
3. **Lower Weightage:** Compiler Design, Digital Logic. (Expect 3-6 marks each).
