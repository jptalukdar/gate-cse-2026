# Context-Free Languages

## Short Notes
Context-Free Languages (CFL) are recognized by Pushdown Automata (PDA) and generated by Context-Free Grammars (CFG).

### Closure Properties
| Operation | CFL | DCFL |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Union | YES | NO |
| Intersect | NO | NO |
| Complement | NO | YES |
| Reverse | YES | NO |
| Intersect with Regular | YES | YES |

## Key Theories & Formulas

### 1. Ambiguity in Grammar
A CFG is ambiguous if there exists at least one string that has:
- More than one Parse Tree.
- More than one Leftmost Derivation.
- More than one Rightmost Derivation.
*Note:* Checking if a CFG is ambiguous is **undecidable**.

### 2. Normal Forms
- **Chomsky Normal Form (CNF)**: $A \to BC$ or $A \to a$.
- **Greibach Normal Form (GNF)**: $A \to a \alpha$.

## Example Problems

**Problem:** Is $L = \{a^n b^n \mid n \ge 0\}$ a CFL?
- **Analysis:** Yes. It can be recognized by a PDA that pushes $a$s and pops them for $b$s.
- **Grammar:** $S \to aSb \mid \epsilon$.

## Hardest GATE Questions

**Topic: Deterministic CFL (DCFL) vs CFL**
**Tricky Question (GATE 2014/2017):**
Is the language $L = \{ww^R \mid w \in \{a, b\}^*\}$ a DCFL?
- **Analysis:** **NO**. It is a CFL, but not a DCFL. A NPDA is needed to guess where the string $w$ ends and its reverse $w^R$ begins.
- **The "Trap":** $L = \{wcw^R\}$ is a **DCFL** because the marker 'c' tells the machine when to start popping.
- **Hard Aspect:** Intersection logic. 
  - $CFL \cap CFL \neq CFL$.
  - $CFL \cap Regular = CFL$.
- **Complexity:** Proving a language is not CFL using the Pumping Lemma for CFLs ($uvwxy$ split).
  - $L = \{a^n b^n c^n\}$ is the classic example of a Non-CFL (CSL).
