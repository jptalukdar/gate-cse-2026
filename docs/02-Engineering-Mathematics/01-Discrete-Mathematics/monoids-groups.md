# Groups and Monoids

## Short Notes
Algebraic structures consisting of a non-empty set combined with one or more binary operations.

- **Closure**: $a * b \in S$.
- **Associativity**: $(a * b) * c = a * (b * c)$.
- **Identity**: $\exists e$ such that $a * e = e * a = a$.
- **Inverse**: $\exists a^{-1}$ such that $a * a^{-1} = e$.

### Hierarchy

- **Semigroup**: Closure + Associativity.
- **Monoid**: Semigroup + Identity.
- **Group**: Monoid + Inverse.
- **Abelian Group**: Group + Commutative ($a * b = b * a$).

## Key Theories & Formulas

### 1. Group Properties

- In a group, the identity element is unique.
- Every element has a unique inverse.
- **Idempotent Law**: The only idempotent element ($x*x=x$) in a group is the identity $e$.
- **Cancellation Law**: $a * b = a * c \implies b = c$ (holds in groups).

### 2. Subgroups & Order

- **Order of Group $|G|$**: Number of elements in $G$.
- **Order of Element $|a|$**: Smallest $n$ s.t. $a^n = e$.
- **Lagrange's Theorem**: Order of a subgroup $H$ divides the order of group $G$. ($|H|$ divides $|G|$).
- **Cyclic Group**: A group generated by a single element ($G = \langle a \rangle$). Every cyclic group is Abelian.
- Number of generators of a cyclic group of order $n$ is $\phi(n)$ (Euler's Totient Function).

## Example Problems

**Problem**: Find the order of element 3 in the group $(\mathbb{Z}_7^*, \times_7)$.

- $\mathbb{Z}_7^* = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$. Identity is 1.
- $3^1 \equiv 3 \pmod 7$
- $3^2 \equiv 9 \equiv 2 \pmod 7$
- $3^3 \equiv 2 \times 3 \equiv 6 \pmod 7$
- $3^4 \equiv 6 \times 3 \equiv 18 \equiv 4 \pmod 7$
- $3^5 \equiv 4 \times 3 \equiv 12 \equiv 5 \pmod 7$
- $3^6 \equiv 5 \times 3 \equiv 15 \equiv 1 \pmod 7$
- Order is 6. This means 3 is a generator for $\mathbb{Z}_7^*$.

## Hardest GATE Questions

**Topic: Number of Subgroups**

**Tricky Question**:
How many subgroups does a group $G$ of order 6 have, if $G$ is non-abelian?

- **Analysis**:
  - A non-abelian group of order 6 must be isomorphic to $S_3$ (Symmetric group of degree 3).
  - Elements: $\{e, (12), (13), (23), (123), (132)\}$.
  - Orders:
    - Order 1: $\{e\}$ (1 subgroup)
    - Order 2: $\{(12)\}, \{(13)\}, \{(23)\}$. Each generates a subgroup of size 2. (3 subgroups)
    - Order 3: $\{(123), (132)\}$. Together with $e$, they make a subgroup of size 3. (1 subgroup)
  - Lagrange's Theorem says subgroup sizes can be 1, 2, 3, 6.
  - Subgroup of order 6 is $G$ itself. (1 subgroup)
- **Total**: $1 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 6$ subgroups.
- **Why it's hard**: Requires knowing the structure of $S_3$ and exhaustively counting based on element orders.
